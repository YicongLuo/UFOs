Finally, we can get the insight that we want:
![use3](static/images/use#3.png)

## Summary

### The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage
This fliter must use the word is exactly same as the table.Ex: The table use date is 1/1/2010. If we use the 01/01/2010, the result is none. 
### Two improvements
1. Add a latest news section to show the most recent sightings.
2. The filters should be to allow for upper and lower cases to search.
